    <h1>History of Coffee</h1>
    <p>As it’s thought that coffee originated in Ethiopia, it’s also believed it made its way north, across the Red Sea into Yemen in the 15th Century. It then started to be grown here in the Yemeni district of Arabia, and by the 16th century, it was known in Persia, Egypt, Syria, and Turkey.</p>
    <p>It was immensely popular for its qualities to help improve alertness and wakefulness, allowing people to devote more time to spiritual matters and praying.</p>
    <p>The world’s first coffee house was opened in Constantinople in 1475, now known as Istanbul. Coffee was drunk at home as part of the daily routine, as well as to show hospitality to guests. Outside of the home, people visited coffee houses to not only drink coffee but to engage in conversation, listen to music, watch performers, play chess, gossip, and catch up on news. Without the modern technologies we have today, coffee houses quickly became the epicentre for exchanging and gaining information. They were often referred to as “Schools of the Wise.”</p>
    <p>And with thousands of pilgrims visiting Mecca each year from all over the world, knowledge of this “wine of Araby”, which it quickly became referred to, began to spread. The founder of the Colony of Virginia, Captain John Smith, introduced coffee to other settlers of Jamestown in 1607. However, it wasn't well received at first, and tea was much more preferred.</p>
    <p>In 1670, Dorothy Jones became the first person to receive a license to sell coffee in Boston. By the mid-1700's, many taverns were also dubbed as coffeehouses, but tea was still the drink of choice. It was only when a rebellion against Great Britain caused all the tea to be thrown into the sea, and it was considered unpatriotic to drink it any longer. Coffee then became increasingly popular.</p>
    <p>The New World's hot, tropical weather was seen as a new ideal for the cultivation of coffee, and coffee plantations quickly spread throughout Central America, with their first coffee harvest occurring in 1726.</p>
